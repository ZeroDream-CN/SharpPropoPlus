        Contributed by Matthew Morrison

        Convert E-Sky CCPM 6 channel signal into 4 orthogonal channels and a 5th for blade pitch

        CCPM operation:
        Rudder: Independent channel.
        Elevator: Obtained by Front servo going up (or down) while both rear servos going down (or up).
        Roll: Obtained by one rear servo going up and one rear servo going down.
        Power: Throttle stick throw obtained from Power channel.
        Input 6 channels are - 
            * Channel 1 (inData[0]) - Rear servo 1
            * Channel 2 (inData[1]) - Front servo
            * Channel 3 (inData[2]) - Power 
            * Channel 4 (inData[3]) - Rudder
            * Channel 5 (inData[4]) - Not used
            * Channel 6 (inData[6]) - Rear servo 2

        Output 5 channels are - 
            * Channel 1 (outData[0]) - Rudder
            * Channel 2 (outData[1]) - Throttle
            * Channel 3 (outData[2]) - Elevator 
            * Channel 4 (outData[3]) - Ailerons
            * Channel 5 (outData[4]) - Pitch
        
        Input:
            channels Pointer to structure containing CCPM channel data
            channels.Count Number of input channels (only the first 6 are relevant)
            channels.Data[] Array of channel values
            min Minimum possible CCPM channel value
            max Maximum possible CCPM channel value

        Return:
            Pointer to structure containing orthogonal channel data (5ch)
